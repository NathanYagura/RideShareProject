Short description of program:

The RideShare program is a simulation used to figure out what percentage of people make it to their randomized destination from a randomized
starting point and are traveling on cars who also have randomized destinations and starting points, but can only hold 3 people. I used 4 main classes to create this 
simulation. The Person class, the station class, the car class, and the road class. The road class was used as a manager for all of the
other classes.

50 passengers and 40 cars result:

For this simulation, I mostly got an average of 60 - 80 percent of the people arrived to their destination.

50 passengers and 20 cars result:

For this simulation, I mostly got an average of 30 - 50 percent of the people arrived to their destination.

Things that I am particularly proud of:

I am particularly proud of my project design. I think that I did a good job designing my code in a way that makes sense and that is
pretty organized

Challenges I faced:

I faced problems with my output (it was kind of messy) and writing functions that I later on did not use.
